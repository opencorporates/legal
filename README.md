# OpenCorporates legal documents

This is a collection of legal documents made available by OpenCorporates for the wider community under an open licence. By doing so, we hope to reduce the burdens of creating and operating companies in the public benefit, and also receive useful feedback to help improve them.

They are not currently intended to be templates that can be immediately be used by others â€“ they are generally  under English law, for example - but instead to allow the central ideas to be used and modified, as well as providing transparency on OpenCorporates' structure and governance.
