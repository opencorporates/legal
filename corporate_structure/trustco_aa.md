**(b)** may be a director or other officer of, or employed by, or a party to any transaction or arrangement with, or otherwise interested in, any body corporate in which the Company is interested or any Group Company or any body corporate in which any Group Company is interested;

**(c)** may act, by himself or through a firm in which he is interested, in a professional capacity for the Company or any Group Company or any body corporate in which any Group Company is interested (otherwise than as auditor); and

**(d)** may hold any other place of profit with the Company (otherwise than as auditor) in conjunction with his office as the directors may determine,

and (i) he shall not, by reason of his office or the fiduciary relationship thereby established, be accountable to the Company for any remuneration or other benefit which he or any other person derives from any such office or employment or from any such transaction or arrangement or from acting in a professional capacity or from any interest in any such undertaking or body corporate; and (ii) no such transaction or arrangement shall be liable to be avoided on the ground of any such interest or remuneration or other benefit; and (iii) receipt of any such remuneration or other benefit shall not constitute a breach of his duty under section 176 of the Act.

**14.2** For the purposes of this article 14 a director shall be deemed to have disclosed the nature and extent of an interest which consists of him being a director, officer or employee of any Group Company.

#### 15. DIRECTORS&#39; CONFLICTS

**15.1** For the purposes of section 175 of the Act, the directors may authorise any matter proposed to them which would, if not so authorised, constitute or give rise to an infringement of duty by a director under that section.  Any such authorisation will be effective only if:

**(a)** any requirement as to quorum at the meeting at which the matter is considered is met without counting the director in question or any other interested director; and

**(b)** the matter was agreed to without their voting or would have been agreed to if their votes had not been counted.

**15.3** Any authorisation of a matter under article 15.1 shall be subject to such conditions or limitations as the directors may specify, whether at the time such authorisation is given or subsequently, and may be terminated or varied by the directors at any time. A director shall comply with any obligations imposed on him by the directors pursuant to any such authorisation.

**15.4** A director shall not, by reason of his office or the fiduciary relationship thereby established, be accountable to the Company for any remuneration or other benefit which derives from any matter authorised by the directors under article 4.1 and any transaction or arrangement relating thereto shall not be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such remuneration or other benefit or on the ground of the director having any interest as referred to in the said section 175.

**15.5** A director shall be under no duty to the Company with respect to any information which he obtains or has obtained otherwise than as a director or officer or employee of the Company and in respect of which he owes a duty of confidentiality to another person. However, to the extent that his connection with that other person conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company, this article 15.5 applies only if the existence of that connection has been authorised by the directors under article 15.1 above. In particular, the director shall not be in breach of the general duties he owes to the Company by virtue of sections 171 to 177 of the Act because he fails:

**(a)** to disclose any such information to the directors or to any director or other officer or employee of the Company; and/or

**(b)** to use any such information in performing his duties as a director or officer or employee of the Company.

**15.6** Where the existence of a director&#39;s connection with another person has been authorised by the directors under article 15.1 and his connection with that person conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company, the director shall not be in breach of the general duties he owes to the Company by virtue of sections 171 to 177 of the Act because he:

**(a)** absents himself from meetings of the director or any committee thereof at which any matter relating to the conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest will or may be discussed or from the discussion of any such matter at a meeting or otherwise; and/or

**(b)** makes arrangements not to receive documents and information relating to any matter which gives rise to the conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest sent or supplied by the Company and/or for such documents and information to be received and read by a professional adviser,

for so long as he reasonably believes such conflict of interest (or possible conflict of interest) subsists.


**15.7** The provisions of articles 15.5 and 15.6 are without prejudice to any equitable principle or rule of law which may excuse the director from:

**(a)** disclosing information, in circumstances where disclosure would otherwise be required under these articles or otherwise; and/or

**(b)** attending meetings or discussions or receiving documents and information as referred to in article 4.6 in circumstances where such attendance or receiving such documents and information would otherwise be required under these articles.

**15.8** For the purposes of this article 15 a conflict of interest includes a conflict of interest and duty and a conflict of duties.

#### 16. RECORDS OF DECISIONS TO BE KEPT

The directors must ensure that the Company keeps a record, in writing, for at least ten years from the date of the decision recorded, of every unanimous or majority decision taken by the directors.
