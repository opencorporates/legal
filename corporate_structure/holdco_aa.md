For the avoidance of doubt holders of shares shall be entitled to be counted in any consent in respect of any proposed transfer of their own shares.

**9.2** A holder may transfer shares to a nominee or trustee for that holder and any nominee or trustee may transfer shares to any other nominee or trustee or to the beneficiary provided that no beneficial interest in the shares passes by reason of any such transfer.

**9.3** Any V Shares or F Shares may be transferred to a holder for the time being of any T Shares.

**9.4** Any F Shares may be transferred to the spouse, civil partner, domestic partner or children (whether natural or adopted) and other lineal descendants of the transferor and/or to a trust of which the only persons who are or are capable of being beneficiaries are the transferor or his/her spouse, civil partner, domestic partner, children (whether natural or adopted), his/her other lineal descendants and charitable bodies.

**10.5** If the Board declines, in accordance with article 8.1, to register the transfer of a share the instrument of transfer must be returned to the transferee with the notice of refusal unless they suspect that the proposed transfer may be fraudulent.

#### 11. TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

**11.1** If title to a share passes to a transmittee, the Company may recognise only the transmittee as having any title to that share.

**11.2** A transmittee who produces such evidence of entitlement to shares as the directors may properly require:

**(a)** may, subject to these Articles, choose either to become the holder of those shares or to have them transferred to another person to whom the holder (from whom the shares passed to the transmittee) could have validly transferred those shares pursuant to these Articles; and

**(b)** subject to these Articles, and pending any transfer of the shares to another person, has the same rights as the holder had.

**11.3** But transmittees do not have the right to attend or vote at a general meeting, or agree to a proposed written resolution, in respect of shares to which they are entitled, by reason of the holder&#39;s death or bankruptcy or otherwise, unless they become the holders of those shares.

**11.4** Transmittees who wish to become the holders of shares to which they have become entitled must notify the Company in writing of that wish.

**11.5** If the transmittee wishes to have a share transferred to another person, the transmittee must execute an instrument of transfer in respect of it.

**11.7** If a notice is given to a shareholder in respect of shares and a transmittee is entitled to those shares, the transmittee is bound by the notice if it was given to the shareholder before the transmittee&#39;s name has been entered in the register of members.

#### 12. NO TRUSTS RECOGNISED

Except as required by law, no person is to be recognised by the Company as holding any share upon any trust and, except as otherwise required by law or these Articles, the Company is not in any way to be bound by or recognise any interest in a share other than the holder&#39;s absolute ownership of it and all the rights attaching to it.

**14.1** Subject to these Articles, the directors are responsible for the management of the Company&#39;s business, for which purpose they may exercise all the powers of the Company.

**14.2** The shareholders may, by special resolution, direct the directors to take, or refrain from taking, specified action.  No such special resolution invalidates anything that the directors have done before the passing of the resolution.

**14.3** Subject to these Articles, the directors may delegate any of the powers which are conferred on them under these Articles:

**(a)** to such person or committee;

**(b)** by such means (including by power of attorney);

**(c)** to such an extent;

**(d)** in relation to such matters or territories; and

as they think fit.

**14.7** The directors may make rules of procedure for all or any committees, which prevail over rules derived from these Articles if they are not consistent with them.

#### 15.DECISION MAKING BY DIRECTORS

**15.1** The general rule about decision-making by directors is that any decision of the directors must be either a majority decision at a meeting or a decision taken in accordance with article 16.

**15.2** If:

**(a)** the Company only has one director; and

**(b)** no provision of these Articles requires the Company to have more than one director,

the general rule does not apply, and the director may take decisions without regard to any of the provisions of these Articles relating to directors&#39; decision-making.

**15.3** A decision of the directors is taken in accordance with this article when all eligible directors indicate to each other by any means that they share a common view on a matter.  Such a decision may take the form of a resolution in writing, where each eligible director has signed one or more copies of it or to which each eligible director has otherwise indicated agreement in writing.

**15.4** References in this article to eligible directors are to directors who would have been entitled to vote on the matter and whose vote would have counted had it been proposed as a resolution at a directors&#39; meeting.

**15.5** A decision may not be taken in accordance with this article if the eligible directors would not have formed a quorum at such a meeting.

**16.2** Notice of a directors&#39; meeting must be given to each director, but need not be in writing.

**16.3** Notice of a directors&#39; meeting need not be given to directors who waive their entitlement to notice of that meeting, by giving notice to that effect to the Company either before, on or after the date on which the meeting is held. Where such notice is given after the meeting has been held, that does not affect the validity of the meeting, or of any business conducted at it.

**16.4** Subject to these Articles, directors participate in a directors&#39; meeting, or part of a directors&#39; meeting, when:

**(a)** the meeting has been called and takes place in accordance with these Articles; and

**(b)** they can each communicate to the others any information or opinions they have on any particular item of the business of the meeting.

**16.5** In determining whether directors are participating in a directors&#39; meeting, it is irrelevant where any director is or how they communicate with each other.

**16.6** If all the directors participating in a meeting are not in the same place, they may decide that the meeting is to be treated as taking place wherever any of them is.

**16.7** At a directors&#39; meeting, unless a quorum is participating, no proposal is to be voted on, except a proposal to call another meeting.

**16.8** The quorum for directors&#39; meetings may be fixed from time to time by a decision of the directors, but it must never be less than two, and unless otherwise fixed it is two.

**16.9** If the total number of directors for the time being is less than the quorum required, the directors must not take any decision other than a decision:

**(a)** to appoint further directors; or

**(b)** to call a general meeting so as to enable the shareholders to appoint further directors.

**16.10** The directors may appoint a director to chair their meetings.  The person so appointed for the time being is known as the chairman.  The directors may terminate the chairman&#39;s appointment at any time.  If the chairman is not participating in a directors&#39; meeting within ten minutes of the time at which it was to start, the participating directors must appoint one of themselves to chair it.

**16.11** The directors must ensure that the Company keeps a record, in writing, for at least ten years from the date of the decision recorded, of every unanimous or majority decision taken by the directors.

**16.12** Subject to these Articles, the directors may make any rule which they think fit about how they take decisions, and about how such rules are to be recorded or communicated to directors.

**17.2** For the purposes of this article 17 a conflict of interest includes a conflict of interest and duty and a conflict of duties.

**17.3** A director may vote, at any meeting of the directors or of any committee of the directors, on any resolution, and may otherwise take, or take part in, any decision, notwithstanding that it in any way concerns or relates to a matter in which he has, directly or indirectly, any kind of interest or duty whatsoever (whether or not it may conflict with the interests of the Company), and if he shall vote on any such resolution (or take, or take part in, any such decision) his vote shall be counted; and in relation to any such resolution as aforesaid he shall (whether or not he shall vote on the same) be taken into account in calculating the quorum present at the meeting.

#### 18. DIRECTORS&#39; CONFLICTS

**18.3** Any authorisation of a matter under article 18.1 shall be subject to such conditions or limitations as the directors may specify, whether at the time such authorisation is given or subsequently, and may be terminated or varied by the directors at any time.

**18.4** A director shall not, by reason of his office or the fiduciary relationship thereby established, be accountable to the Company for any remuneration or other benefit which derives from any matter authorised by the directors under article 18.1 and any transaction or arrangement relating thereto shall not be liable to be avoided on the grounds of any such remuneration or other benefit or on the ground of the director having any interest as referred to in the said section 175.

**18.5** A director shall be under no duty to the Company with respect to any information which he obtains or has obtained otherwise than as a director or officer or employee of the Company and in respect of which he owes a duty of confidentiality to another person.

**(a)** absents himself from meetings of the directors or any committee thereof at which any matter relating to the conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest will or may be discussed or from the discussion of any such matter at a meeting or otherwise; and/or

**(b)** makes arrangements not to receive documents and information relating to any matter which gives rise to the conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest sent or supplied by the Company and/or for such documents and information to be received and read by a professional adviser,

### (a..a)for so long as he reasonably believes such conflict of interest (or possible conflict of interest) subsists.

**(a)** disclosing information, in circumstances where disclosure would otherwise be required under these Articles or otherwise;

to attend and speak at a general meeting.

**23.11** The chairman of the meeting may adjourn a general meeting at which a quorum is present if:

**(a)** the meeting consents to an adjournment; or

**(b)** it appears to the chairman of the meeting that an adjournment is necessary to protect the safety of any person attending the meeting or ensure that the business of the meeting is conducted in an orderly manner.

**23.12** The chairman of the meeting must adjourn a general meeting if directed to do so by the meeting.

**(a)** allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the meeting; and

**(b)** appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment of the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting itself.

**23.26** A person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote (either on a show of hands or on a poll) at a general meeting remains so entitled in respect of that meeting or any adjournment of it, even though a valid proxy notice has been delivered to the Company by or on behalf of that person.

**23.27** An appointment under a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering to the Company a notice in writing given by or on behalf of the person by whom or on whose behalf the proxy notice was given.

**(b)** the proposed amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion of the chairman of the meeting, materially alter the scope of the resolution.

**23.31** A special resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be amended by ordinary resolution, if:

**(a)** the chairman of the meeting proposes the amendment at the general meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed; and

**(b)** the amendment does not go beyond what is necessary to correct a grammatical or other non-substantive error in the resolution.

**23.32** If the chairman of the meeting, acting in good faith, wrongly decides that an amendment to a resolution is out of order, the chairman&#39;s error does not invalidate the vote on that resolution.

**24.4** A person to whom shares are transferred is not obliged to ensure that any purchase money is received by the person entitled to the relevant fractions.

#### 26.DIVIDENDS


**26.1** The Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends, and the directors may decide to pay interim dividends.

**26.2** No dividend may be declared or paid unless it is in accordance with shareholders&#39; respective rights.

**26.3** Unless the shareholders&#39; resolution to declare or Board&#39;s decision to pay a dividend, or the terms on which shares are issued, specify otherwise, it must be paid by reference to each shareholder&#39;s holding of shares on the date of the resolution or decision to declare or pay it.

**26.4** If the Company&#39;s share capital is divided into different classes, no interim dividend may be paid on shares carrying deferred or non-preferred rights if, at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is in arrears.

**26.5** The Board may pay at intervals any dividend payable at a fixed rate if it appears to it that the profits available for distribution justify the payment.

**26.6** If the Board acts in good faith, it does not incur any liability to the holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by the lawful payment of an interim dividend on shares with deferred or non-preferred rights.

**26.7** Where a dividend or other sum which is a distribution is payable in respect of a share, it must be paid by one or more of the following means:

**(a)** transfer to a bank or building society account specified by the distribution recipient either in writing or as the Board may otherwise decide;

**(b)** sending a cheque made payable to the distribution recipient by post to the distribution recipient at the distribution recipient&#39;s registered address (if the distribution recipient is a holder of the share), or (in any other case) to an address specified by the distribution recipient either in writing or as the Board may otherwise decide;

**(c)** sending a cheque made payable to such person by post to such person at such address as the distribution recipient has specified either in writing or as the directors may otherwise decide; or

**26.10** All dividends or other sums which are:

**(a)** payable in respect of shares; and

**(b)** unclaimed after having been declared or become payable,

may be invested or otherwise made use of by the Board for the benefit of the Company until claimed.

**26.11** The payment of any such dividend or other sum into a separate account does not make the Company a trustee in respect of it.

**26.12** If:

**(a)** 12 years have passed from the date on which a dividend or other sum became due for payment; and

**(b)** the distribution recipient has not claimed it,

the distribution recipient is no longer entitled to that dividend or other sum and it ceases to remain owing by the Company.

**26.13** Subject to the terms of issue of the share in question, the Company may, by ordinary resolution or by a resolution or other decision of the Board, decide to pay all or part of a dividend or other distribution payable in respect of a share by transferring non-cash assets of equivalent value (including, without limitation, shares or other securities in any company).

**26.14** For the purposes of paying a non-cash distribution, the Board may make whatever arrangements it thinks fit, including, where any difficulty arises regarding the distribution:

**(a)** fixing the value of any assets;

**(b)** paying cash to any distribution recipient on the basis of that value in order to adjust the rights of recipients; and

**(c)** vesting any assets in trustees.

**26.15** Distribution recipients may waive their entitlement to a dividend or other distribution payable in respect of a share by giving the Company notice in writing to that effect, but if:

**(a)** the share has more than one holder; or

**(b)** more than one person is entitled to the share, whether by reason of the death or bankruptcy of one or more joint holders, or otherwise,

the notice is not effective unless it is expressed to be given, and signed, by all the holders or persons otherwise entitled to the share.

**(a)** on behalf of the persons entitled; and

**(b)** in the same proportions as a dividend would have been distributed to them.
