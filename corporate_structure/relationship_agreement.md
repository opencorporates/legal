2. PUBLIC BENEFIT PURPOSE

The parties consider and agree that it is in the public interest and for the public benefit to create, increase and promote transparency of the corporate and business world, including the existence, ownership and activities of entities, and the people connected with them (the **&quot;Public Benefit Purpose&quot;**).

3. ACHIEVING THE PUBLIC BENEFIT PURPOSE

  3.1 The parties consider and agree that the Public Benefit Purpose can and should be furthered by, amongst other things:

    (a) encouraging Governments and regulators (**&quot;Authorities&quot;**) to require information regarding information on business entities, including their activities, accounts, ownership, influence over or similar to be made available to the Authorities in a comprehensive and timely manner;

    (b) encouraging Authorities to make such information generally available free of charge to the public at large in easily analysable forms and as openly licensed machine readable data (the **&quot;Information&quot;**);

    (c) developing and maintaining software the purpose of which is to aggregate the Information into regularly updated databases;

    (d) making the contents of those aggregated databases generally available to the public at large through websites and search functions (but subject in each case to appropriate exemptions e.g. to reflect data protection, security and maintenance issues) (the **&quot;Basic Services&quot;**);

    (e) developing and maintaining software that provides additional functionality and analyses the information in bespoke ways set by the user (**&quot;Specialist Services&quot;**); and

    (f) provides programmatic access to the information via an Application Programming Interface or via exports as structured data (**&quot;Structured Data&quot;**).

  3.2 The parties further agree the following principles (the **&quot;Principles&quot;**):

    (a) it is for the public benefit for the use of and output of the Basic Services to be made freely available to the public generally on the internet;

    (b) it is for the public benefit for the Specialist Services and Structured Data to be made available free of charge to journalists, NGOs (whether charitable or not) (and other similar individuals and organisations) as such use is likely either directly or indirectly to be for the public benefit and for that availability and use to be actively promoted and encouraged;

    (c) it is for the public benefit for commercial organisations wishing to have access to the Specialist Services and Structured Data to be required to pay commercial rates for that access because whilst their use thereof may not be directly for the public benefit it is unlikely to be contrary to the public benefit and the revenue thereby generated will fund the costs of providing the services referred to in (a) and (b) above and will allow a return to be paid on outside investment, the obtaining of which investment which will also enable the Public Benefit Purpose to be furthered; and

    (d) it is for the public benefit for the HoldCo Group to seek to achieve increases in the use of the services referred to above.

  3.3 The parties recognise that the categorisation of users between those referred to in clause 3.2(b) and those referred to in clause 3.2(c) will not always be obvious and judgments in that regard will need to be made.

  3.4 The parties agree that the HoldCo Group should pursue the Public Benefit Purpose in a manner consistent with the Principles, on the terms of this agreement.

4. GOVERNANCE

  4.1 This clause 4 sets out the parameters the parties have agreed (for the benefit of all parties) should be set around the activities of the HoldCo Group and Business.

  4.2 HoldCo shall not (without Approval), and shall so far as it is able procure that no other member of the Holdco Group shall (except with Approval), engage in any activity that is not consistent with the Public Benefit Purpose.

  4.3 OpCo and IPCo shall not (without Approval) engage in any activity that is not consistent with the Public Benefit Purpose.

  4.4 The HoldCo Board will be responsible for making any judgments of the type referred to in clause 3.3 above but if the matter is material (either individually or because it sets, or potentially sets, a precedent or policy) the HoldCo Board must consult with the Trust Board regarding the matter.  The ultimate decision shall, however, lie with the HoldCo Board.

  4.5 Subject to the above the HoldCo Board and the OpCo Board shall (to the extent it lies in their respective powers to do so) operate the Business in a manner in which they consider in good faith most likely to achieve the Public Benefit Purpose in a manner consistent with the Principles and which, subject to that, maximises the profits and cash generation of HoldCo and OpCo.

  4.6 IPCo and OpCo shall comply with its obligations under the IP Licence.

  4.7 If HoldCo acquires or incorporates a subsidiary undertaking (other than OpCo and IPCo) it shall procure that that subsidiary undertaking adheres to this agreement so as to be bound by it in the same manner as OpCo.

  (b)
  use or disclosure of Confidential Information required to be disclosed by law or any regulatory body provided that a party required to disclose any Confidential Information shall promptly notify the Dislosee, where practicable and lawful to do so, before disclosure occurs (as the case may be) and shall co-operate with the Disclosee regarding the timing, manner and content of such disclosure (as the case may be) or any action which the Disclosee may reasonably elect to take to challenge the validity of such requirement;

  (c) disclosure of Confidential Information to professional advisers on a confidential basis for the purpose of advising the party making the disclosure; or

  (d) disclosure of Confidential Information which becomes generally known other than by a Party&#39;s breach of any other provision of clause 8.
